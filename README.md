# Scott's Portfolio

Welcome to the code that generates my [portfolio website](https://kangabru.github.io/)!

This page uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to generate the site.

## Usage

### Want your own page like this?

Fork this repo and follow the instructions listed on the [GitHub Pages website](https://pages.github.com/).

Learn about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to make the most out of your new site.

### Local Install

Follow these instructions to run Jekyll and test your site locally without deploying to GitHub:
- [Download Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
- Install [Bundler](https://bundler.io/): `$ gem install bundler`
- Install required gems: `$ bundle install`
- Run Jekyll: `$ jekyll serve`

Jekyll will then generate all necessary files and host them at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) for you to test out.
