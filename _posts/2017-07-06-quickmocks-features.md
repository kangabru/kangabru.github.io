### Designed for Devs
Love writing dev specs? Me neither. Specing even the simplest of forms can become verbose when written down. Use `QM` to take an existing form, add some fields, update some labels, change an icon or two and your finished. A picture tells a thousands words and `QM` lets you make them in seconds.

`QM` was loved by devs for specing up tasks, screen designs, bug fixes etc. Managers even complained that the mocks looked too real! So I created a 'mockify' filter to make images look more mock-like.

### Adopted by Designers
Why use Photoshop or Balsamic to recreate screens you already have? Simply load an existing page and use `QM` to refine it. This saved designers time and effort in our ever growing suite of products. Users could save fully editable pages to collaborate and iterate on designs too!

### Unexpected Users
To my surprise `QM` broke out of the R&D bubble and was used broadly adopted throughout the company. Marketing and Sales teams became frequent users and used them for videos and live demos.

## History
The original version was built in a single day for the first 'Hack Day' at a prior company (1000+ employees). It placed 2nd and was released for general use soon after. Over the following months it was adopted by 300+ employees through which I gained valuable feedback.

A year later `Quick Mocks 2` was released offering dozens of powerful new features including draggable elements and fully editable page saves. The release was the primer for two additional awards - a second 'Hack Day' win and the 'Innovation of the Year 2018' award.

No `QM`-like utility existed at the time but [similar tools](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/ProjectVisBug) have popped up.

### Why was it popular?
I believe that this concept worked particularly well at this company for one reason: we had thousands of screens, and every screen followed a consistent design.

Building a new product? The general layout and UI elements probably exist. `QM` simply lets you paste in the components you want, tweak some labels, and you're 90% there. Any dev and tester can now envision the objective and get up to speed quickly. For this reason `QM` was a hit at first sight.
