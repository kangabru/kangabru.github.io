## Key Points
- Static webpages which are generated by `Jekyll` and then deployed on GitHub Pages.
- Content is written using `Markdown` and `Liquid`, and styled by `HTML` and `CSS`.
- The `Liquid` templating engine is used to dynamically generate content and pages.

## Features

Why _build_ websites when you can generate them? Add in free hosting and you've got a winner. At least this was my thinking when I made this thing.

`Jekyll` - a static site generator - allows me to write simple `Markdown` files which are automatically converted into static webpages when pushed to my [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) repo.

Pages can be as simple as you like, but my implementation makes extensive use of [Liquid templates](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) to dynamically generate content - the list of my projects on the [home page](/) for instance.

`Liquid` also makes dynamic tagging possible. Try it, [click here](/tags/JS){:.tag}

## Tech Specs

### ![Jekyll](/icons/jekyll.png) Jekyll
- Used for static webpage generation. I simply write `Markdown` files, spruce them up with a little `CSS` and `HTML`, and deploy.
- Deployed on GitHub Pages - the `Jekyll` generate process is run when pushed to the repo. A simple, free, setup-less deployment process.
- Is easy to get started with, yet has great extensibility for more advanced content.

### ![Python](/icons/python.png) Python
- Used for generating tag pages - the pages you go to when you [click a tag](/tags/Python){:.tag}.
- It simply parses projects, finds all tags, and creates simple definition files.
- `Jekyll` generates the final web pages whilst `Liquid` dynamically links to them.
