## Tech Specs

This is a single page application built from the ground up by me. The app utilises various technologies that I wanted to try out at the time.

### ![Firebase](/icons/firebase.png) Firebase
- Uses Firebase for hosting, auth, photo storage, and cloud functions.
- Cloud functions are used to create image thumbnails, and to compress DB entries into a single read on page load.
- Firebase was chosen for fantastic dev usability, and low cost, and Google Cloud Platform integration.

### ![React](/icons/react.png) React
- All code is run client side which simplifies deployment. I simply need to host the static files which negates to need to manage a traditional server/DB setup.
- Allows for a component based design which is allows for complicated, yet maintainable single page applications.
- React and NPM have an amazing and diverse ecosystem which allows for fast development.

### ![Redux](/icons/redux.png) Redux
- Redux is used to manage a centralised application state.
- Server call responses update the Redux state, which React then uses to render the UI.
- The one way data flow reduces bugs, and allows for easy UI testing based on state data.

### ![Performance](/icons/cog.png) Performance
- The initial page load is kilobytes which loads instantly and signals the load is rendering.
- Home page data is loaded in a single DB read, as is the data for each individual album.
- Server calls, larger client side processes, and UI rendering are all async.
- Thumbnails are used extensively to improve loading speed and animation performance.

### ![JS Packages](/icons/javascript.png) JS Packages
- **Tailwinds CSS:** A fantastic library which generates atomic CSS utility classes. This simplifies and reduces the size of CSS, and helps reduce unexpected CSS breakages. It looks great too and simplifies creating responsive CSS.
- **Leaflet**: Renders and handles all maps used in the app.
- **Redux Thunk**: Enabled async redux actions.
- **React Router**: Enables url navigation with the single page app.
- **Webpack**: Builds the app. Includes transpiling Typescript, compiling Less, building Tailwinds, running dev/prod builds, tree shaking etc.
- **Jest**: Used for JS and UI testing.
